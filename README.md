## 🩷 About the Project

**Access** is a social innovation project focused on making private transportation more inclusive and accessible for **people with disabilities (PwDs)** in urban environments.

The initiative was born from a real and pressing challenge: despite the growth of ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Lyft, many users with disabilities still face **barriers**, **discrimination**, and **lack of accessibility**. A notable example is the fine imposed on Uber in the United States for charging additional fees to PwD users — an incident that sparked a deeper discussion about **inclusion in mobility**.

---

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to **analyze and improve the accessibility** of private transportation platforms through a combination of **research, user engagement, and technological proposals**.

We carried out a detailed **field research study**, using structured and ethical methods, to identify the biggest pain points faced by PwD users when using private transport services. We explored:

- How platforms handle accessibility today  
- What are the real experiences of users with disabilities  
- What systemic improvements can be proposed to create an **equitable transport ecosystem**

---

## Methodology

Our research included:

-  Structured interviews and surveys with PwD users
-  Data analysis focused on accessibility gaps
-  User experience mapping to identify pain points
-  Ideation of practical solutions and policy recommendations

---

## Key Insights & Solutions Proposed

- Development of accessibility filters for ride-hailing apps (e.g. "Wheelchair-friendly vehicle")
- Specialized driver training programs focused on inclusive service
- Real-time accessibility support in app interfaces
- Legal compliance and transparency reports for platforms
- User rating systems focused on accessibility experience
